        <h4>Most learners first encounter since as a preposition, as in ‘Turkey has been a republic since 1923’ or ‘Everything has changed so much since last spring'. Since can also function as a conjunction linking two clauses together, as in ‘I’ve known Joanna since she was born’ or ‘I hadn’t seen her since she went to live in Oxford’. In such cases it is normally used with the present perfect or past perfect tense, either in the simple or continuous form. As a conjunction, since can also be used to mean ‘as’ or 'because’, as in ‘I shall not be able to attend the meeting since I shall be on holiday with my family’ or ‘Since there’s no more business, we can all go home’.</h4>
